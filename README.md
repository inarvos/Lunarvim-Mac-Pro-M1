LunarVim is a feature-rich, extensible Neovim configuration that comes with sensible defaults for coding, editing, and plugin management. This configuration enhances the base functionality of LunarVim with some additional plugins, comfortable keybindings, and custom settings.


Plugin Enhancements

This configuration includes a variety of plugins to boost productivity and coding experience:

- Colorschemes: A selection of aesthetically pleasing colorschemes including Moonfly, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Kanagawa, Nightfox, Gruvbox, Iceberg, and more.
- File Explorers: NERDTree and CHADTree for efficient file navigation.
- Folding: 'nvim-ufo' plugin for advanced folding capabilities using treesitter and indentation methods.
- Renaming: 'renamer.nvim' for easy renaming of variables and functions.
- Error Handling: 'trouble.nvim' to manage and display diagnostics and errors.
- Miscellaneous: Plugins like 'nvim-scrollview' for enhanced scrolling experience and 'mason.nvim' for managing external tools.


Comfortable Keybindings

Custom keybindings are set to improve usability and efficiency:

- Window Management: Easy shortcuts for splitting windows, moving between them, and resizing.
- Terminal: Quick access to the terminal within Neovim.
- Telescope: Integrated with Telescope for fuzzy finding files, live grep, buffers, and more.
- Git Commands: Keybindings for Git actions using Telescope.
- Cursor and Folding: Enhanced cursor settings and folding mappings for better navigation and code management.


This repository is mainly about keybindings I used in LunarVim and currently use with Neovim, which is also available on my Git.
